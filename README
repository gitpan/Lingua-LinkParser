Description

   To quote the Link Grammar documentation, "the Link Grammar Parser 
   is a syntactic parser of English, based on link grammar, an original 
   theory of English syntax. Given a sentence, the system assigns to it 
   a syntactic structure, which consists of set of labeled links 
   connecting pairs of words."

Requirements

   To install Lingua::LinkParser you must have already downloaded, 
   compiled and install the Link Parser package from 
   http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/.

   This module has been compiled and tested with Perl 5.005_03 on 
   Linux 2.2.13.

Installation

   To begin installation type:

       perl Makefile.PL

   This will ask you where your Link Parser package directory is 
   located, and must contain the distribution obj/ and include/ 
   directories, with obj/ containing compiled object files.

   Once the Makefile is written, you can build and test with:

      make
      make test

   The test will load the parser dictionary files and parse a sample 
   sentence. If they do not, back up and figure out why before 
   installation. To install:

      make install

Documentation

   Full documentation is available in pod format within the .pm file:

      perldoc Lingua::LinkParser

   or

      perldoc ./LinkParser.pm


Todo

   Documentation is lacking for many functions, and not all of the API
   functions have corresponding Perl entries. Help!
