LINUX USERS:

   There is a namespace compatability conflict documented at:

     http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=4428

   If you get segfaults or "dictionary creation" errors, follow the advice 
   of Alan Buckeridge:

     There's a routine called 'advance' in the file 'read-dict.c' in the
     parser's source directory.  By replacing each occurrence of "advance"
     with something else (I used "ad_vance") and recompiling the parser, I
     was able to 'make' and 'make test' for Lingua::LinkParser.

   This has fixed the problem in all cases, as far as I'm aware. Thanks Alan.

DESCRIPTION

   To quote the Link Grammar documentation, "the Link Grammar Parser 
   is a syntactic parser of English, based on link grammar, an original 
   theory of English syntax. Given a sentence, the system assigns to it 
   a syntactic structure, which consists of set of labeled links 
   connecting pairs of words." Version 1.10 of this module implements the 
   new 4.2.2 parser API currently maintained by AbiSource and available 
   from http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/ .

REQUIREMENTS

   To install Lingua::LinkParser you must have already downloaded, 
   compiled and installed the Link Parser package.

   This module has been compiled and tested with Perl 5.6 and 5.8 on Linux 
   2.2.13 & 2.2.14, and Perl 5.6 and 5.8 on OS X. Any incompatibilities 
   *should* be the result of lib issues within the Link Parser itself, but 
   these seem very stable.

INSTALLATION

   Before you build this package, it is highly recommended that you install 
   the link parser package with 'make install', which will put the libs, 
   headers, and dictionary files in standard locations. This build no longer
   prompts for package directories, so if you want to build with non-standard
   locations, you'll need to edit Makefile.PL to make that happen. In particular,
   pay attention to the INCLUDE parameter.

   To begin installation type:

      perl Makefile.PL

   Once the Makefile is written, you can build and test with:

      make
      make test

   On Linux, the make displays several warnings about redefined macros -
   these messages may be ignored.

   The test will load the parser dictionary files and parse a sample 
   sentence. If they do not, back up and figure out why before 
   installation. To install:

      make install

DOCUMENTATION

   Full documentation is available in pod format within the .pm file:

      perldoc Lingua::LinkParser

   The scripts in 'scripts/' demonstrate a general overview of the 
   functionality.

TODO

   I need to add quite a few tests. I'd like there to be a large test suite 
   of sentences.
