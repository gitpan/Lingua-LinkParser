EB connects adverbs to forms of "be" before an object, adjective, 
or prepositional phrase: 

            +------------O-----------+
        +-S-+--EB--+                 |
	 |  |      |                 |
	He is apparently a good programmer

Forms of "be" therefore have an optional "EB+", conjoined with
O+ and B- (for objects), Pa+ (for adjectives), Pp+ (for
prepositions), and other things. Note that "EB+" is not
conjoined with Pg+ and Pv+; this is because present and
passive participles have @E- connectors, so they can connect
to adverbs using these.

Certain adverbs can also be used in comma modifiers, following
the first comma:

           +------MX-------+
	   | +----Xc-------+                  
           | +--EB--+      +-----Xd-----+
           | |      |      |            |
	A man, apparently in a bad mood , was there

	A man in a bad mood was there	
	*A man apparently in a bad mood was there

As the third example shows, if an adverb is to be used in such
situations, the modifying phrase must be surrounded by commas.
For this reason, it is simplest to make the adverb attach directly
to the preceding comma. (This is the only case where words attach
to each other <b>via</b> a comma.) We then give commas "{@EB+} & Xc+".
(See "<a href="section-X.html">X</a>" for more on commas.) 

Now the only problem is that while many adverbs that can
follow "be" can also follow commas, some cannot: "He is really
a good player", "*John, really a good player, beat
everyone". Thus adverbs that cannot follow a comma are given
"EBm-", and the comma is given "EBx+".

EB#m relates to comparatives; see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>: Comparatives II".

Adverb".
