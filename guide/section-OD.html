OD is used for a few verbs like "rise" and "fall" which can take
expressions of distance as complements. 

	    +----OD----+
            |     +-ND-+
	    |     |    |
	It fell five feet

Words like "feet" therefore have "OD-". (The special ".i" entry
for distance nouns, used in other distance expressions, is
used here.)  In financial writing, one often sees such verbs
used with "points", percentages, or just ordinary numbers;
therefore we allow this also:

	GM stock fell five points
	GM stock fell 2%
        GM stock fell 2 1/2
