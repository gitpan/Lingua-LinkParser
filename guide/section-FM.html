FM connects the prepositon "from" to various other prepositions.

	        +--MVp-+--FM--+----J----+
		|      |      |         |	
	John screamed from inside the house
			   under the bed
			   behind the car
			
	*John screamed from with the dog

"From" is unusual in that it can take many prepositional
phrases as objects (rather than noun phrases). "From"
therefore has "(FM+ or J+) & (MVp- or Mp- or CO+...)";
it can serve this function whether it is acting as a
verb modifier, noun modifier, opener, etc.. Prepositions
that can serve as objects of "from" have "J+ & (MVp- or Mp-
or CO+ ... or FM-)".
