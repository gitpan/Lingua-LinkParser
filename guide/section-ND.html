ND connects numbers with certain expressions which require numerical
determiners:

                    +-ND--+-Yt-+
	            |     |    |
	I saw him three weeks ago

Also "The store is FIVE MILES away", "FIFTY PERCENT of them
were women", "THREE OTHER people are coming", "These are the
TWO BIGGEST buildings in the city". In each of these cases,
the word on the right of the link - not the number - is used
to link the word to the rest of the sentence. ND is also used
to connect numbers to the percent sign "%"; this can then be
used as a noun-phrase.

Numbers can also be used to modify the word "more", when it is
acting as a plural determiner or noun: "Three more are
coming", "Three more people are coming", "*Three more money is
needed". Thus "more" has ND- optionally conjoined with its
plural-determiner and plural-noun connectors.

Notice that ND is not used for ordinary noun-phrase number
expressions: "Fifty people came to the party", "Fifty came to
the party". For these purposes, numbers have ordinary plural
determiner (Dmc-) and noun (S+/O-/J-) connectors. ND+ is only
used when a numerical determiner is required:

	I saw him three weeks ago
	*I saw him the weeks ago
	*I saw him Jane's weeks ago
	These are the two biggest buildings
	*These are the some biggest buildings

ND+ on numbers is directly disjoined with the plural determiner
and noun-phrase connectors, and conjoined with other connectors
like NN- and EN-, used in building larger number expressions:

                    +-----EN-----+
                    |     +--NN--+--ND--+
	            |     |      |      |
	I saw him about fifty million years ago
