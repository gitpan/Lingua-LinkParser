CQ is used to connect to auxiliaries in cases where the
subject and auxiliary are inverted, and where the complement
need of the auxiliary is satisfied by a word before it. Such
situations include comparatives, with "more...than" or
"as...as", as well as other situations involving "as".

Normally, subject-verb inversion is tightly constrained; it
may only occur in certain types of questions. To allow it in
situations such as these, we must add "CQ" to a special list
of connectors in post-processing which permit (and in fact
require) s-v inversion.  See "<a href="section-SI.html">SI</a>: Questions Requiring S-V
Inversion"; see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>: Comparatives V".
