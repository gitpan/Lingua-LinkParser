OT is used for a few verbs like "last" which can take time
expressions as objects:

	     +-----OT----+
  	     |     +--ND-+
	     |     |     |
	It lasted five years

	?I've been working on this five years
	*It lasted five books

(Constructions like the second above are sometimes seen; we
disallow them.)  In questions, the object of such verbs may be
fronted; in such cases, BT is used. In such cases, the phrase
"how many" must precede the noun. This is analagous to an
ordinary "how many" object-type question, like "how many dogs
did you chase". (See "<a href="section-EA.html">EA</a>h".) BT is analogous to the usual B; TQ 
is analogous to Dmc.

                   +-----BT----+
         +-H--+-TQ-+           |
         |    |    |           |
	How many years did it last

Thus we give "many" "H- & TQ+"; we give "years.i" "TQ- & BT+".
