    YS</font></kbd></b>
<PRE>
YS connects nouns to the possessive suffix "'s". "'s" then acts 
as a determiner, making a D connection to a noun.

          +-YS-+-D-+
	  |    |   |
	Jane  's  dog is black

Plural nouns take only an "'"; "The students' dogs are black".
This uses YP rather than YS. The dictionary thus includes the
following:

	's: YS- & D+;
	': YP- & D+;

A possessive pronoun ("Jane's") can also act as a complete
noun phrase: "Jane's is black". Thus the expressions "'s" and
"'" also carry the main expression carried by nouns "(S+ or O-
etc.)". This usage is rare, however; we therefore give it a
cost of 2.

All proper and common singular nouns have YS+; all plural
nouns have YP+. (YS is also used for plural forms that don't
end in 's': "Men's legs are longer than women's". For this
reason it was necessary to create separate dictionary
categories for plural nouns ending in 's' and not ending in
's'.)  Nouns which form possessive determiners in this way -
whether singular or plural - take their own determiners and
adjectives just like ordinary nouns (ex. 1-6 below). However,
they may not take post-modifiers like relative clauses
(ex. 7-8); nor, of course, may they act as subjects or
objects. Thus YS+ and YP+ on nouns must be conjoined with "@A-
& D+", disjoined with everything else.

	1.The rich student was tall
	2.The rich student's car was black
	3.*Student was tall
	4.*Student's car was black
	5.Students are tall
	6.Students' cars are black
	7.The man I met was tall
	8.*The man I met's car was black

In a few weird cases, a noun can take both a possessive
determiner and another determiner; these cannot be handled ("A
girls' school" is rejected).
