Z connects the preposition "as" to certain verbs.

         +-----CO--+
         +--Z--+   |
         |     |   |
	As I said, I like broccoli

Some verbs which take clausal complements - "threaten", "say",
"mention" - can also be used in constructions like the above;
in such cases, the complement requirement of the verb - which
may be mandatory ("*I said") - is satisfied.  Such verbs
therefore have "Z-" disjoined with their other complement
connectors (TH+, Ce+, etc.). The word "as" has "Z+" disjoined
with "Cs+" (used in conjunction phrases) and J+ (used for
prepositional objects). Z+ is conjoined with "CO+ or MVs-";
this allows such phrases as closers as well: "I like broccoli,
as I said".

as.p: (Z+ or J+ or Cs+) & (CO+ or MVs-);

The Z link can also be used in comparative expressions:

	He was not as late as I expected
	?He was not as late as I said

"As.z" (the second "as" in a comparative expression) therefore
has Z+ as well. However, some verbs can be used in this
construction only as openers and closers, not as comparatives
(such as "said" above).  Therefore we subscript the connector
on "as.z" Zc+; verbs with can not take Z in comparatives have
Zs-.

"As" phrases of this kind can also be used without a subject:

	He likes broccoli, as was expected
	He earns as much as was expected

 Here, the phrase "was expected" has two demands: "is" demands
 a subject, and "expected" demands a complement.  "As" must
 fulfill both of these demands. So "as" has a subject
 connector, optionally conjoined with the Z+.
							
	as.z: ({SFsic+} & Zc+

			   +----Z-----+
		           +SF-+--Pv--+
		           |   |      |
	he earns as much  as was expected

"Than" may also be used in this way. The use of comparatives
is highly constrained by post-processing: see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>:
Comparatives III".

The "Zc" link here starts a domain, which includes only the
"than" or "as" phrase.  Note also that the subject link here
is an "SF", not a "S", and that it is subscripted.  In
post-processing, we then enforce the same restrictions on the
verbs that may occur with "SFsic" that we enforce with the
filler subjects "it" and "there". Thus we allow "...than
seemed to be expected", but prohibit "...than wanted to be
expected", etc.. See "<a href="section-SF.html">SF</a>: Filler-it" for more explanation.
