MF is used in this construction:

                         +-------MVx-------+                
                         |     +-----Xd----+                
                         |     |   +---MF--+-------Xc------+
  +--Dmc-+--Spx--+---Pa--+     |   |   +IDN+---Jp--+       |
  |      |       |       |     |   |   |   |       |       |
Many people.p were.v injured.a , some of them children.n ///// 

This unusual construction requires a special arrangement. It
involves a noun-phrase surrounded by commas, consisting of
a phrase like "many [/some/five/several] of them" followed
by a noun phrase. In our handling of this construction, "of_them"
is an idiomatic expression which serves as the head of the phrase.
