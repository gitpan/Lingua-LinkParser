A connects pre-noun ("attributive") adjectives to nouns. Any
number of adjectives can be used; all connect to the noun.

                  +----A----+
                  |    +-A--+
                  |    |    |
	We saw a big black dog 

Nouns thus have optional "@A-" connectors, conjoined with "D-"
connectors and with their main "S+ or O- or J-..." complex.
The "@A-" occurs first on the expression, since it must
connect closer than both the determiner and the main
connection: "*We saw big a dog", "*Big we saw a dog".

A+ on adjectives is disjoined with Pa-, used in predicative
adjective constructions.  Many adjectives take complements
such as clauses or infinitival phrases; but such complements
may not be used when the adjective is being used prenominally
("The man was eager to go", "*The eager to go man is
here"). Thus the A+ connectors on adjectives must be disjoined
with complement connectors like TO+, TH+, and QI+. Adjectives
thus carry "A+ or (Pa- & [complement])".

Some adjectives, such as superlatives and number adjectives
("biggest", "first"), must be used with a definite determiner
such as "The" or "His". See "<a href="section-L.html">L</a>".

All hyphenated expressions are treated as adjectives, and may
be used either prenominally or predicatively; they therefore
carry both A+ and Pa- (e.g., "bone-headed").

A few adjectives can act only as predicative adjectives, not
prenominal ones ("asleep", "alone"). These have no A+
connector. A few others, like "former", are only prenominal,
and carry A+ but not Pa-.

Many participles can also act as prenominal adjectives; these,
also, have A+ connectors. The situation here is complicated.
Present participles of intransitive verbs have A+ connectors;
those of transitive verbs do not ("The sleeping child", "*The
hitting child"). Many passive participles have A+ connectors;
this applies only to transitive verbs, since only transitive
have passive forms ("The destroyed building"). (A few
intransitive past participles also take A+: "The fallen
horse".) Past participles of "complex" verbs - those requiring
complements like infinitives or clauses - do not carry A+
("*The hoped agreement"); those of complex verbs which can
take direct objects carry A+ in some cases, not in others
("The reported incident", "*The seen man"). (Note: Do not
confuse participle-adjectives with full-fledged adjectives
which happen to be participles, like "amused" and "annoying":
"It is very annoying", "*It is very destroyed". The litmus
test for real adjectives is that they can take modifiers such
as "very"; see "<a href="section-EA.html">EA</a>".)

A+ connectors on adjectives (but not participle-adjectives)
are conjoined with an optional Xc+; this allows commas to be
inserted after any prenominal adjective in a list ("The big,
bad, ugly bear"). (This also allows doubtful usages such as
"The big, bear", "The big bad ugly, bear".) See "<a href="section-X.html">X</a>".

Attributive adjectives are also allowed on proper nouns with 
cost 2. See "<a href="section-D.html">D</a>: Determiners and Adjectives on Proper Nouns".

Am is used with comparatives: see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>: Comparatives I".
