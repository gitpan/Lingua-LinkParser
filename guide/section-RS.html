RS is used in subject-type relative clauses. 

	     +----B----+
	     +-R-+-RS--+
             |   |     |
	The dog who chased me was black

Finite verbs have a B- connector disjoined with their S-
connectors which connects to the main noun of a relative
clause.  This B- is conjoined with a RS-; when the B- is used
to connect back to a noun, an RS connection must be formed as
well. This is supplied by the relative pronoun.

	died arrived: (S- or (RS- & B-));
	who: (R- & (RS+ or C+));

See "<a href="section-R.html">R</a>" for a full discussion of relative clauses.

A complicated situation arises when the verb of a subject-type
relative is itself contained in an embedded clause.

             +------B------------+
             +-R-+--C-+-S--+-RS--+
             |   |    |    |     |   
        The dog who John said chased me was black

The "who" makes a C connection to the outer subject of the
relative constituent, just as if it was an object-type
relative.  But in this case, the "B" on the main noun is
connecting to the relative verb as a subject, not an
object. The verb therefore requires a RS connection.
Moreover, the outer verb of the relative constituent, "said",
requires a complement (normally it makes a "TH" or "C"
connection to the subject of a embedded clause: "John SAID HE
was coming"; "*John said"). Thus we give such verbs a "RSe+"
connector, conjoined with their other complement connectors.
(In this situation, the RS link must start a domain; this is
the reason for the "e" subscript.)

Notice that in the above case - unlike other subject-type
relatives - the relative pronoun may be omitted: "The dog
John said chased me was black". This follows naturally from
the current system.

<b>Other "RS" Constructions</b> 
Because the relative pronoun may be omitted here, and because
(either via the relative pronoun or directly) the antecedent
is making a clause connection to the subject of the relative
clause, this situation has a lot in common with object-type
relative clauses; yet the antecedent is the implied subject of
the embedded clause, not the object. In this way, other "B+"
connectors can be used that are normally used in object-type
constructions, for example, those on question-words,
"whatever"-type words, and "transitive" adjectives (the latter
case is a little weird, but we allow it):

	Who do you think hit John
	Whatever you think will work is fine
	?John is easy to think hit Joe
