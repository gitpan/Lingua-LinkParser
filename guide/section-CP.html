CP is used with verbs like "say", which can be used in a quotation
or paraphrase:

     +-------------------CP---------------------+
     |                        +-------Xd--------+
     |                        |         +---S---+-Xc-+
     |                        |         |       |    |
  ///// The President is busy , the spokesman said /////

Verbs that can take quotational complements of this kind have
"CP-", directly disjoined with their other complement connectors.
The verb must connect to commas on either side (or to the right-
hand wall); see "<a href="section-X.html">X</a>c".

say: (S- or I-...) & (O+ or Ce+ or TH+ or (Xd- & Xc+ & CP-));

Verbs that can be used this way can usually also be placed 
elsewhere in the sentence - either after an opener (ex. 1), or
after the subject phrase (ex. 2). In the first case, they use
COq; in the second case, they use Eq. 

                +-------------S---------------+
                |                       +-Eq--+
                |                       |     |
1.	The President , the spokesman said , is busy

        +---------------------CO--------------------+
        |                              +-----COq----+
        |                              |            |
2.	At the moment , the spokesman said , the President is busy

Verbs such as "say" therefore have the following:

	(S- or I-) & (O+ ... or (Xd- & Xc+ & (CP- or Eq+ or COq-)));

The category of verbs that can take quotations like this cuts
across other verb categories. For that reason, it seemed
simpler to designate new dictionary entries for
quotation-taking verbs; these entries have only the complement
connectors used in quotation (CP, Eq, and COq). Such entries
are subscripted with ".q" ("say.q", etc.).

Quotation complement connectors - Eq, CP, and COq - are all
domain-starting. The structures created in such sentences are
rather unusual, however. With domains, the usual principle is
to have embedded clauses nested inside the domains of main
clauses. In cases of quotation, it would seem (semantically
anyway) that the quoting verb (e.g. "say") is the main clause,
and the quotation itself is dependent on it. Therefore, we
make the quoting expression start a domain which includes the
quoted expression. In the case of Eq and COq, these links are
simply made domain-starting links. In the case of CP, the "Wd"
connector on the wall already starts a domain which only
includes the quoted statement. CP is then made to start an
"urfl" domain (of type 'd'), which includes both the quoted
statement and the quoting statement.

     +-------------------CP(d)------------------+
     |                        +-------Xd(d)-----+
     +-S(d(m))-+              |         +--S(d)-+Xc(d)+
     |         |              |         |       |     |
  /////	The President is busy , the spokesman said  /////	

CPi is used with verbs taking paraphrase statements which
also require "filler-it" as subject: "The President is busy,
it seems". See "<a href="section-SF.html">SF</a>: filler-it".
