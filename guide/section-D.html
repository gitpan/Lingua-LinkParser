D connects determiners to nouns.

         +-D-+
	 |   |
	The dog ran

Nouns have D- connectors conjoined with their main "S+ or O-
or J-..." expression. The D- is listed first on the expression,
since it must connect closer than the main connection: "I saw
the dog", "*The I saw dog".

Many words can act as either determiners or noun-phrases: "some",
"many", "all", "this", and a number of others. Such words have
D- disjoined with the main "S+ or O-..." found on nouns:

        many: Dmc+ or Sp+ or O-...;

The first two subscript places on D connectors relate to number
agreement. Consider the following simplified entries.

	the: D+;
	a: Ds+;
        some: Dm+;
	many: Dmc+;
	much: Dmu+;

	dog: Ds- & ...;
	dogs: {Dmc-} & ...;
	water: {Dmu-} & ...;
	war: {D*u-} & ...;
	
Essentially there are three categories of noun and determiner:
singular, mass, and plural.  The first subscript place
distinguishes between singular ("s") and everything else
("m"); the second place distinguishes between plural ("c") and
mass ("u") (for "countable" and "uncountable"). Nouns and
articles which are singular-only have Ds; those which
are plural-only have Dmc; those which are mass-only have Dmu;
nouns which may be singular or mass have D*u-; determiners which
may be plural or mass have Dm+; and determiners which may be
mass, plural or singular have D+. (A few nouns, such as "fish",
may be plural or singular; for these we create multiple 
dictionary entries.)

<b>D##w: Question-determiners</b>
The third subscript place on D connectors relates only to
post-processing. D##w connectors are used for question-
determiners: "which", "what" and "whose". The "w" triggers
post-processing constraints relating to question-inversion;
see "<a href="section-SI.html">SI</a>: Questions without s-v inversion". D##w connectors are
conjoined on question-determiners with other left-pointing
connectors (QI- and W-); therefore such determiners cannot be
used in normal declarative sentences, since no linkage will be
found ("*I bought which eggs today"). Other false positives arise
here which require post-processing; see "<a href="section-B.html">B</a>: More about dependent
clauses".

<b>Determiners and Adjectives on Proper Nouns</b>
In general, proper nouns do not take determiners. However, there
are a number of exceptions. A number of proper nouns may take
the determiner "the": "The Emir of Kuwait died", "The Supreme 
Soviet met today". For this we use the DG connector; see
"<a href="section-DG.html">DG</a>". Beyond this, however, one quite often sees proper names
taking determiners, for example with brand-names or with people.

	?The new David Letterman is a happy, secure David Letterman.
	?I bought a Toyota to carry my Macintosh 

Thus we give proper nouns D- with cost 2. Note that in the first
case the proper noun carries an adjective as well; this is also
not uncommon in more colloquial writing. Thus proper nouns carry

	[[{@A-} & {D-}]] & (Ss+ or O- or J-...)

In giving proper nouns D- and A- connectors, we are
essentially allowing them to be treated like common
nouns. Other common-noun-like usages are not permitted: we do
not allow proper nouns to act as plural forms or to take
post-nominal modifiers such as prepositional phrases (but see
"<a href="section-JG.html">JG</a>"). These usages do occasionally arise, however - with
brand-names, for example. Some words for nations and
religions, such as "American(s)" and "Muslim(s)", really seem
like full-blown common nouns; thus they are included in
ordinary common noun categories.

Other D subscripts relate to comparatives; see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>: Comparatives",
sections I (Dm#m) and VII (Dm#y). Dm#k and Ds#k relate to the
construction "such...that"; see "<a href="section-EA.html">EA</a>xk: so...that".
