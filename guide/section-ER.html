ER is used in the construction "the X-er..., the Y-er...":
    
      +------ER----------+
 +-DG-+                  +-DG-+
 |    |   	         |    |
The better it is,       the more people will use it
The more people use it, the better it is

Such constructions always use comparative adjectives or
adverbs. They consist essentially of two similar phrases,
attached together by an ER link. (Any phrase that can occur in
the first half can occur in the second, as the above examples
suggest.) The comparative adjective is always the "head" of
each phrase. Each comparative adjective must have the capacity
to serve as either the first or second half of the
expression. The complement links (i.e., those that connect
within the phrase) are the same, whether the adjective is
serving as a "first-half" or a "second-half".  Such adjectives
therefore have:

bigger: ( complement ) & DG- & ((Wd- & Xc+ & ER+) or ER-)
		
			         ----------------      ^ 
		                  for first-half  for second-half
			            phrase	     phrase

The DG- connects to the definite article "the"; the Xc+
connects to a comma; the Wd- to the wall; and the ER
from one phrase to the other.

The connectors used within the phrase are mostly those
discussed elsewhere:

	The bigger it is	AF+
	The more you run	Cs+
	The more you earn	B+
	The more money you earn Dm*w+
						
An exception is the following construction:

              +-TR--+--U---+
	      |     |      |
	The better the computer , the faster the program

For such constructions, the word "the" has "TR- & U+".
Nouns have U-; this special connector is disjoined with
all other optional and mandatory connectors on nouns
(except AN- and A-); see "<a href="section-U.html">U</a>".
