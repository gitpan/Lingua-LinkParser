SFI connects "filler" subjects "it" and "there" to invertible
verbs in questions with s-v inversion:

	+SFI+
        |   |
	Is it likely that Jane will go
	Is there going to be a problem

Both the use of "it" and "there" and the use of subject-verb
inversion are highly constrained by post-processing (see "<a href="section-SF.html">SF</a>";
see "<a href="section-SI.html">SI</a>"). However, there is nothing especially problematic
about SFI; SFI is to SF precisely as SI is to S.
