EZ connects certain adverbs to the word "as", like "almost",
"just", and "about":

                   +--EZ-+
	           |     |
	I did it almost as quickly as he did

The expression "[number] times" can also be used in this way;
"I did it three times as quickly as he did". The only usage of
"as" that can be modified in this way is the first "as" in a
comparative expression; "*I did it as quickly almost as he
did". Thus "EZ-" only appears on "as.y", which is the
dictionary expression for this usage.
