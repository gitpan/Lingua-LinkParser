AF connects adjectives to verbs in cases where the adjective
is "fronted", such as questions and indirect questions.

             +-AF-+                    +------AF---------+
	     |    |                    |                 |
	How big  is it   I wonder how big he wants it to be

Verbs that can take adjectival complements, like "be", "seem",
and "make [obj]", have AF- disjoined with their Pa+ connectors
(and any other complement connectors).  Adjectives have AF+
connectors disjoined with their A+ and Pa-. The constructions
above can only be used with the question-word "how" modifying
the adjective: "*Very big is it". This is enforced by
connector logic: the sentence must connect to the wall
somehow. "How" has a W- connector; adjectives and adjectival
adverbs like "very" do not. "How" also has a QI- connector,
for use in indirect questions like ex. 2 above. Connector
logic thus ensures that the only way the AF+ connectors on
adjectives can be used is if they connect through "how" to
something on the left.

Moreover, as shown by the examples above, if the AF occurs
in the main clause, s-v inversion must occur; if not (i.e.,
if it is an indirect question), s-v inversion may not occur.
This is enforced in post-processing; see "<a href="section-SI.html">SI</a>".

If the adjective has complements, these must occur after the
subject of the sentence: "HOW certain ARE you that he is
coming?" This is enforced by the ordering of the elements on
adjective expressions: "AF-" precedes "(TH+ or TO+...)". 
("*How certain that he is coming are you" seems questionable; 
we reject it.) 

AFd, AFdi, and AFm are used with comparatives: see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>:
Comparatives", sections II (AFm), V (AFd), VI (AFdi).
