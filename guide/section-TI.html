TI is used for titles like "president" and "chairman", which
can be used in certain circumstances without a determiner:
after the preposition "as" or after verbs liked "name" or "elect".

        +--------------CO-------------+ 
        +--TI--+-Mp---+               |
        |      |      |               |
	As president of the company, it is my decision

                  +----TI--+ 
		  |        |             
	She was named president of the company

There are special dictionary entries for the no-determiner
usage of these nouns:

president.i chairman.i: {@M+} & (BI- or (Xd- & Xc+ & MX-) or TI-);

As this expression shows, such nouns can also be complements
of "be" ("She is president of the company"), using BI-; and
they can also form comma expressions modifying a noun ("Jane
Smith, president of the company, ..."), using MX-.
