TH connects words that take "that [clause]" complements with the
word "that". These include verbs ("I assured him that..."),
nouns ("The idea that...") and adjectives ("We are certain
that...").

             +---TH----+
             |         |
	I assured her that I would finish the project
	The idea      that we would hire John is preposterous
	I'm certain   that she could do a good job

The word "that" therefore has "TH- & Ce+". The Ce+ connects to
the subject of a following clause (see "<a href="section-C.html">C</a>").

Verbs that can take "that"+clause have TH+ disjoined with
their other complement connectors (O+, TO+, etc.). With many
such verbs, the "that" is optional; they thus carry "TH+ or
Ce+", allowing a direct connection to the subject of the
subordinate clause.  Some verbs can take object+"that" ("I
told him that I was angry"); such verbs have "O+ & {TH+}."
Adjectives like "certain" have "TH+" disjoined with other
complement connectors. Nouns like "idea", "opinion", and
"argument" have TH+ conjoined with {@M+} (used in
prepositional phrases) but disjoined with {R+ & B+} (used in
relative clauses); this is somewhat arbitrary.

THb+ connectors are used to connect forms of "be" to "that".
The reason for this is that only certain nouns can serve as
the subject in such cases: "The problem is that John is
coming", "*The dog is that John is coming". To enforce this,
we give such nouns "Ss*t+" connectors instead of the usual
"Ss+".  We then insist in post-processing that a group
containing a THb must contain an Ss#t.

THi+ connectors occur on certain adjectives ("important")
which may only take "that+clause" when "filler-it" is the
subject.  This distinction involves post-processing.  See
"<a href="section-SF.html">SF</a>: Filler-it" for further explanation. THc is used with
comparatives; see "<a href="section-MV.html">MV</a>: Comparatives VI".
