AZ connects the word "as" back to certain verbs that can take 
"object-as-adjective" as a complement:

              +---AZ---+
              +-O--+   +-Pa-+
              |    |   |    |
        She viewed him as stupid

"As" thus has AZ- conjoined with Pa+ (used in ordinary predicate
uses of adjectives). Verbs like "view" and "describe" have
"O+ & {AZ+}", disjoined with other complement connectors.
