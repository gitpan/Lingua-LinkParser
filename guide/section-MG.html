MG allows certain prepositions to modify proper nouns. We do
not allow most prepositions to modify proper nouns ("*John
with the big nose is here") but we do allow it with "of" and
"for": "The Society for Creative Anachronisms is meeting",
"The Ongle of Bongle Dongle died today"). MG must be used with
JG, forcing the object of the preposition also to be
capitalized ("The Society for Creative Anachronisms is
meeting", "*The Society for creative anachronisms is
meeting").
