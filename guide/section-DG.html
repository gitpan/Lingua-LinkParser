DG connects the word "the" with proper nouns. In general, proper nouns 
may not take determiners; but we do allow proper nouns to take
the determiner "the". This allows things like "The Emir of
Kuwait died", "The Supreme Soviet met today", but not "*I have
known many Kuwaits", "*We need a Soviet". Other uses of
determiners with proper nouns are allowed with cost 2; see "<a href="section-D.html">D</a>:
Determiners with Proper Nouns".

DG is used in the construction "The X-er, the Y-er." See "<a href="section-ER.html">ER</a>".
It is also used in certain idiomatic time expressions like "I
left the moment I saw him"; see "<a href="section-TT.html">TT</a>".
