    Q</font></kbd></b>
<PRE>
Q is used in questions, in several different ways. It is
used to connect to auxiliaries in simple s-v inversion
questions, when there is no preceding object. In some cases
the auxiliary connects to the wall (ex. 1 below).  In other
cases it connects to a question-word like "when", "where", or
"why" (ex. 2).

         +--Qd-+
	 |     |            
       /////  Are you going to to the movie

         +--W-+-Q-+
         |    |   |
       ///// Why did you go

In noun-focused questions, either object-type or subject-type,
the question-word connects to the verb ("What did you buy",
"Who bought that"). In the former case, there is s-v
inversion, but no "Q" connection is made. Thus the "Q-" is
optional on auxiliaries.

Post-processing ensures that when a question-word is used in
object-type or when-where-why questions (not subject-type
questions), the outer group of the sentence contains some kind
of SI; this is because in all such cases, a Wq is used to
connect to the wall, and this requires an SI in the same
group. Post-processing further ensures that SI links can only
be used when a Wq is present (see "<a href="section-SI.html">SI</a>"). However, in simple
yes-no questions, question inversion must occur, yet no
question word is present. Thus the Q+ on the wall is
subscripted "Qd", and this is added to Wq on the list of
link-types that permit s-v inversion.

(Note that the Q- on auxiliaries is conjoined with SI+, but
disjoined with S-; by link logic it can only be used with
SI+. Post-processing tightly constrains the use of SI, preventing
it from occurring in indirect questions, relative clauses, etc.;
the use of Q is thus automatically constrained as well.)

Q is also used for questions with prepositions: "IN which room
WERE you working", "TO whom WERE you speaking". See "<a href="section-JQ.html">JQ</a>",
"J".

<b>Qe: Adverbial questions</b>
Qe is used to connect adverbs to following auxiliaries in
adverbial questions:

                     +---I---+
         +EEh-+--Qe--+-SI+   |
         |    |      |   |   |
	How quickly did you run

Qe can only be used in questions ("*Very quickly did you
run").  This is enforced by the fact that the sentence must
connect to the wall, and can only do so through "how". Again,
the use of Qe in indirect questions is prevented because Q- on
auxiliaries is conjoined with SI, whose use is constrained by
post-processing.

One false positive must be addressed here, however:

         +------------B-------+
         |           +----I---+
         |    +--Qe--+-SI-+   |
         |    |      |    |   |
      *	Who quickly did Jane hit

We prohibit this in post-processing by requiring that a group
containing a Qe must contain an EEh - a link-type occurring
only on the word "how".
