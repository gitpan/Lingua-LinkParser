1.0   Wed Aug 16 14:35:44 2000
    - Rewritten for the new Link Grammar 4.0 API
    - Got LinkParser.xs to work with the char** functions, so 
      linkage_get_words and get_domain_names now work.
    - Makefile.PL changes LinkParser.pm to find data directory
    - new() expects a hash defined the the pod documentation, and uses the 
      the global $DATA_DIR to as a default path
    - Added Lingua::LinkParser::Definitions to enable easy retrieval of 
      link summaries and definitions from within the program. This is a 
      totally non-orthoganal method of distributing this info, but I find 
      it handy.
    - Added linkage_get_word to ::Linkage, thanks Richard A. Wells.
    - Added linkage_get_words, also thanks to Richard.
    - Added access to the domain functions with num_domains and domain_names 
      to the Lingua::LinkParser::Sublinkage class.
    - Added function 'violation_name' to Lingua::LinkParser::Linkage class to 
      return the label for a post-processing linkage violation.
    - Added the new 'print_constituent_tree()' from the 4.0 API to display 
      constituent tree structures.
    - Added tests to 'test.pl' for 'get_words()', 'num_domains()', and 
      'domain_names()'
    - Added scripts to demonstrate use of 'bigstruct()' and 'define()'
    - Added script to demonstrate 'print_constituent_tree()'
    - Included the link guide in directory 'guide', since it's not in the 
      distribution.
    - Overloaded the stringify operators ("") for classes ::Sentence,
      ::Linkage, and ::Sublinkage to display a diagram for each.
    - Changed 'get_postscript' to use new 'mode' parameter
    - Added the link functions that had previously only been available to 
      sublinkage objects to linkage objects.
